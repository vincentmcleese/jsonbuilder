# **Design Principles for n8n Workflow JSON Generator**

## **Brand Foundation (Aligned with Ghost Team)**

### **Visual Identity**

* **Primary Colors**: Clean white background with black text (matching Ghost Team's clean aesthetic)  
* **Brand Green**: \#32da94 as the primary accent color (Ghost Team's signature green)  
* **Secondary Colors**: Light grays for backgrounds and subtle borders  
* **Typography**: Clean, modern sans-serif fonts that convey professionalism and clarity  
* **Ghost Theme**: Subtle use of "ghost" metaphors in UI elements (translucent cards, floating elements)  
* **Logo Integration**: Consistent use of Ghost Team branding and green ghost icon

### **Tone & Voice**

* **Professional yet Approachable**: Technical enough for credibility, simple enough for beginners  
* **Outcome-Focused**: Emphasize time savings and business results over technical features  
* **Confident but Humble**: "We'll help you automate" not "We're the best automation tool"  
* **Ghost Team Alignment**: Consistent with "automation specialists working behind the scenes"

## **Core Design Principles**

### **1\. Progressive Simplicity**

**Principle**: Start simple, reveal complexity only when needed

**Implementation**:

* Show only 3-4 industry options initially, expand on user selection  
* Use single-screen flows with clear progress indicators  
* Hide advanced options behind "Advanced Settings" toggles  
* Present information in digestible chunks with clear headings

**Example**: Industry → Category → Sub-category → Tools (one step at a time)

### **2\. Confidence Through Clarity**

**Principle**: Users should never feel lost or uncertain about next steps

**Implementation**:

* Always show current step and what comes next  
* Use descriptive button text: "Generate My LinkedIn Outreach Automation" not "Generate"  
* Include time estimates: "This will take about 2 minutes to set up"  
* Provide clear success criteria: "You'll save 3 hours per week on lead follow-up"

**Visual Cues**:

* Progress bars with step names  
* Breadcrumb navigation  
* Clear section headings  
* Visual confirmation of selections

### **3\. Outcome-First Design**

**Principle**: Focus on business results, not technical complexity

**Implementation**:

* Lead with value propositions: "Automate your LinkedIn outreach"  
* Show expected time savings prominently  
* Use business language over technical jargon  
* Include success stories and social proof

**Content Strategy**:

* Headlines focus on outcomes: "Generate 50% more qualified leads"  
* Descriptions explain business impact  
* Examples use real business scenarios  
* CTAs emphasize benefits: "Save 5 hours per week"

### **4\. Guided Success**

**Principle**: Hold users' hands through the entire journey

**Implementation**:

* Pre-filled examples in input fields  
* Smart defaults for tool selections  
* Inline help text with context  
* Preview of what will be generated before committing

**Support Elements**:

* Tooltips explaining technical terms  
* "Why do we ask this?" explanations  
* Example workflows for each category  
* Visual previews of automation flow

### **5\. Trust Through Transparency**

**Principle**: Build confidence by showing exactly what's happening

**Implementation**:

* Explain what the generated JSON will do  
* Show required credentials upfront  
* Provide realistic time estimates for setup  
* Include limitations and requirements clearly

**Trust Signals**:

* Customer testimonials and usage stats  
* Clear pricing and what's included  
* Detailed setup instructions  
* No hidden requirements or surprise costs
